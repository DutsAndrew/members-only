# members-only

Members-Only is a Back-End Chat Application with user authentication. Users can create accounts, which are authenticated through passport's library and bcryptjs's library to provide password encryption. Upon authentication, cookies are stored through passport to maintain user log-in throughout use of the application. In addition another layer of authentication is set by only allowing certain roles to have access to or even see certain parts of the application. Users are able to perform a full array of CRUD operations when it comes to the 'messaging' part of the application.

<strong>Tools:</strong>
- JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, Passport, bcryptjs, EJS, and other libraries (check package.json to see more)

<strong>Build:</strong>
1. This was a fun build, it was fun to get the full CMV (Controllers, Models, and Views) architecture design principles down on this one. This is my third time using the CMV model and I feel extremely confident in using it now. I had the most fun writing the controller and models as I really enjoy figuring out how to get and post data to the database.
2. EJS is coming more naturally, this is the third app that I've built that uses EJS and I feel confident in using it.
